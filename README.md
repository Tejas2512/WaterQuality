Build web application using flask and python to predict water potability.

## Context
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

## About Data

ppm: parts per million\
μg/L: microgram per litre\
mg/L: milligram per litre

**Column description:**

**1. ph:** pH of 1. water (0 to 14).\
**2. Hardness:** Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.\
**3. Solids:** Total dissolved solids in ppm.\
**4. Chloramines:** Amount of Chloramines in ppm.\
**5. Sulfate:** Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L.\
**6. Conductivity:** Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm.\
**7. Organic_carbon:** Amount of organic carbon in ppm.\
**8. Trihalomethanes:** Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L.\
**9. Turbidity:** Measure of light emiting property of water in NTU.\
**10. Potability:** Indicates if water is safe for human consumption. Potable is 1 and not potable is 0.
